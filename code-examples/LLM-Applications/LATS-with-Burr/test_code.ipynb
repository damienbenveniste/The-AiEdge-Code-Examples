Birds'}, {'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_birds', 'content': 'This clashes with previous studies that found a very rapid radiation of avian orders only after the K-Pg extinction.[17][18] The results of this study have been disputed by other researchers, due to a lack of fossil evidence to support its conclusions.[19]\\\\nThe birds that survived the end-of-Cretaceous extinction were likely ground-dwelling (not arboreal) and thus persisted despite the worldwide destruction of forests.[20][21]\\\\nAn analysis of the variation of diversification rates through time further revealed a potential effect of climate on the evolution diversification rates in birds in which the generation of new lineages accelerates during periods of global cooling.[13] This can be the result of climate cooling fragmenting tropical biomes and producing widespread allopatric speciation plus an effect of some lineages diversifying in the expanding arid and cool biomes.[13]\\\\nBird skull evolution decelerated compared with the evolution of their dinosaur predecessors after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, rather than accelerating as often believed to have caused the cranial shape diversity of modern birds.[22][23]\\\\nClassification of modern species[edit]\\\\nThe phylogenetic classification of birds is a contentious issue. The skeleton of all early bird candidates is basically that of a small theropod dinosaur with long, clawed hands, though the exquisite preservation of the Solnhofen Plattenkalk shows Archaeopteryx was covered in feathers and had wings.[5] While Archaeopteryx and its relatives may not have been very good fliers, they would at least have been competent gliders, setting the stage for the evolution of life on the wing.\\\\n Phylogenetically, Aves is usually defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of a specific modern bird species (such as the house sparrow, Passer domesticus), and either Archaeopteryx,[2] or some prehistoric species closer to Neornithes (to avoid the problems caused by the unclear relationships of Archaeopteryx to other theropods).[3] If the latter classification is used then the larger group is termed Avialae. The discoveries of further basal dromaeosaurids potentially capable of powered flight, such as Xiaotingia, has provided more evidence for the theory that flight was first developed in the bird line by early dromaeosaurids rather than later by Aves as was previously supposed.[8]\\\\nAlthough ornithischian (bird-hipped) dinosaurs share the same hip structure as birds, birds actually originated from the saurischian (lizard-hipped) dinosaurs if the dinosaurian origin theory is correct.'}, {'url': 'https://evolution.berkeley.edu/what-are-evograms/the-origin-of-birds/', 'content': 'The discovery that birds evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs of the Late Jurassic was made possible by recently discovered fossils from China, South America, and other countries, as well as by looking at old museum specimens from new perspectives and with new methods.

Similarly, there is no agreement on the timing of diversification within the three major avian groups: Palaeognathae (tinamous and ratites), Galloanseres (waterfowl, pheasants, and allies), and the megadiverse Neoaves (all other birds); whereas most molecular estimates date the early radiation within these groups before the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) transition (5, 7, 10–14), with very few exceptions fossils have been found only after the K-Pg extinction event (6, 15–17).

But what makes birds so successful, and how did the early ancestors of modern birds survive the mass extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous Period when the non-avian dinosaurs died out? Birds'}, {'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_birds', 'content': 'This clashes with previous studies that found a very rapid radiation of avian orders only after the K-Pg extinction.[17][18] The results of this study have been disputed by other researchers, due to a lack of fossil evidence to support its conclusions.[19]\\\\nThe birds that survived the end-of-Cretaceous extinction were likely ground-dwelling (not arboreal) and thus persisted despite the worldwide destruction of forests.[20][21]\\\\nAn analysis of the variation of diversification rates through time further revealed a potential effect of climate on the evolution diversification rates in birds in which the generation of new lineages accelerates during periods of global cooling.[13] This can be the result of climate cooling fragmenting tropical biomes and producing widespread allopatric speciation plus an effect of some lineages diversifying in the expanding arid and cool biomes.[13]\\\\nBird skull evolution decelerated compared with the evolution of their dinosaur predecessors after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, rather than accelerating as often believed to have caused the cranial shape diversity of modern birds.[22][23]\\\\nClassification of modern species[edit]\\\\nThe phylogenetic classification of birds is a contentious issue. The skeleton of all early bird candidates is basically that of a small theropod dinosaur with long, clawed hands, though the exquisite preservation of the Solnhofen Plattenkalk shows Archaeopteryx was covered in feathers and had wings.[5] While Archaeopteryx and its relatives may not have been very good fliers, they would at least have been competent gliders, setting the stage for the evolution of life on the wing.\\\\n Phylogenetically, Aves is usually defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of a specific modern bird species (such as the house sparrow, Passer domesticus), and either Archaeopteryx,[2] or some prehistoric species closer to Neornithes (to avoid the problems caused by the unclear relationships of Archaeopteryx to other theropods).[3] If the latter classification is used then the larger group is termed Avialae. The discoveries of further basal dromaeosaurids potentially capable of powered flight, such as Xiaotingia, has provided more evidence for the theory that flight was first developed in the bird line by early dromaeosaurids rather than later by Aves as was previously supposed.[8]\\\\nAlthough ornithischian (bird-hipped) dinosaurs share the same hip structure as birds, birds actually originated from the saurischian (lizard-hipped) dinosaurs if the dinosaurian origin theory is correct.'}, {'url': 'https://evolution.berkeley.edu/what-are-evograms/the-origin-of-birds/', 'content': 'The discovery that birds evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs of the Late Jurassic was made possible by recently discovered fossils from China, South America, and other countries, as well as by looking at old museum specimens from new perspectives and with new methods.

The first animals that scientists describe as bird-like are feathered dinosaurs. “As it had some features that we see in modern birds, but others that were much more dinosaur-like, I’m uneasy about calling Archaeopteryx a bird. Archaeopteryx\\\\xa0is about 150 million years old, which makes it arguably one of the oldest truly bird-like dinosaurs discovered so far. But what makes birds so successful, and how did the early ancestors of modern birds survive the mass extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous Period when the non-avian dinosaurs died out? Birds'}, {'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_birds', 'content': 'This clashes with previous studies that found a very rapid radiation of avian orders only after the K-Pg extinction.[17][18] The results of this study have been disputed by other researchers, due to a lack of fossil evidence to support its conclusions.[19]\\\\nThe birds that survived the end-of-Cretaceous extinction were likely ground-dwelling (not arboreal) and thus persisted despite the worldwide destruction of forests.[20][21]\\\\nAn analysis of the variation of diversification rates through time further revealed a potential effect of climate on the evolution diversification rates in birds in which the generation of new lineages accelerates during periods of global cooling.[13] This can be the result of climate cooling fragmenting tropical biomes and producing widespread allopatric speciation plus an effect of some lineages diversifying in the expanding arid and cool biomes.[13]\\\\nBird skull evolution decelerated compared with the evolution of their dinosaur predecessors after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, rather than accelerating as often believed to have caused the cranial shape diversity of modern birds.[22][23]\\\\nClassification of modern species[edit]\\\\nThe phylogenetic classification of birds is a contentious issue. The skeleton of all early bird candidates is basically that of a small theropod dinosaur with long, clawed hands, though the exquisite preservation of the Solnhofen Plattenkalk shows Archaeopteryx was covered in feathers and had wings.[5] While Archaeopteryx and its relatives may not have been very good fliers, they would at least have been competent gliders, setting the stage for the evolution of life on the wing.\\\\n Phylogenetically, Aves is usually defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of a specific modern bird species (such as the house sparrow, Passer domesticus), and either Archaeopteryx,[2] or some prehistoric species closer to Neornithes (to avoid the problems caused by the unclear relationships of Archaeopteryx to other theropods).[3] If the latter classification is used then the larger group is termed Avialae. The discoveries of further basal dromaeosaurids potentially capable of powered flight, such as Xiaotingia, has provided more evidence for the theory that flight was first developed in the bird line by early dromaeosaurids rather than later by Aves as was previously supposed.[8]\\\\nAlthough ornithischian (bird-hipped) dinosaurs share the same hip structure as birds, birds actually originated from the saurischian (lizard-hipped) dinosaurs if the dinosaurian origin theory is correct.'}, {'url': 'https://evolution.berkeley.edu/what-are-evograms/the-origin-of-birds/', 'content': 'The discovery that birds evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs of the Late Jurassic was made possible by recently discovered fossils from China, South America, and other countries, as well as by looking at old museum specimens from new perspectives and with new methods.

Instead, one must synthesize the information across multiple sources to extract the correct species and relevant stats needed for the final output. Notably, there was mention of the domestic chicken as the most common bird, but details about size, weight, or age were scattered and not defined directly in the search results.
